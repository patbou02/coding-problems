  <h1>Good morning!</h1>
  <h2>Here's your coding interview problem for today.</h2>
  <p>This problem was recently asked by <strong>Uber</strong>.</p>
  <p>Enter description here...</p>
  <p>Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.</p>
  <p>For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].</p>
  <p>Follow-up: what if you can't use division?</p>
  <p>View console to find out more...</p>
